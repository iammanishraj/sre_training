# Key Principles of a SRE
## Reliability
- Reliability is a core principle of SRE, often described as the measure of a system's ability to perform its intended function without failure, within an acceptable time frame, and under expected conditions.It's a multifaceted concept encompassing several key aspects:   

1. **Availability:** This is the most straightforward aspect, referring to the system's ability to be up and running when users need it. It's often measured using metrics like uptime percentages.   

2. **Latency:** This refers to the time it takes for a system to respond to a user request. Low latency is crucial for a good user experience, especially in applications like e-commerce or online gaming.   

3. **Throughput:** This measures the system's capacity to handle a certain volume of requests or data. A reliable system can handle peak loads without significant performance degradation.   

4. **Error Rate:** This indicates the frequency of errors or failures within the system. A low error rate is essential for maintaining a stable and predictable service.   

5. **Recoverability:** This refers to the system's ability to quickly recover from failures or disruptions. This includes mechanisms like failover, redundancy, and automated recovery procedures.   

6. **Change Failure Rate:** This measures the frequency of service disruptions caused by changes to the system, such as software updates or infrastructure modification
