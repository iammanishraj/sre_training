## Overview
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to IT operations. It focuses on building and maintaining large-scale, distributed systems that are reliable, efficient, and scalable. 

## What does a site reliability engineer do ?

* SRE teams are responsible for how code is deployed, configured, and monitored, as well as the availability, latency, change management, emergency response, and capacity management of services in production.

* SRE teams determine the launch of new features by using service-level agreements (SLAs) to define the required reliability of the system through service-level indicators (SLI) and service-level objectives (SLO). 

* Site reliability engineers split their time between operations tasks and project work. According to SRE best practices from Google, site reliability engineers can only spend a maximum of 50% of their time on operations—and they should be monitored to ensure they don’t go over.  
The rest of the their time should be spent on <mark>development tasks</mark> like creating new features, scaling the system, and implementing automation.
Automation is an important part of the site reliability engineer’s role. If they are repeatedly dealing with a problem, then they will likely automate a solution. 
Maintaining the balance between operations and development work is a key component of SRE. 

* <mark>Monitoring and logging</mark> play a key role in SRE. SRE teams use monitoring tools to track what is happening in software systems in real-time. Monitoring makes it possible to fix immediate technical issues and helps teams anticipate future problems and solve for them before they occur.

* SRE teams also look for systems deficiencies through a process called <mark>chaos engineering</mark>. Chaos engineering is a strategy that site reliability engineers implement to intentionally cause failures in production and pre-production environments. The purpose of chaos engineering is to understand the impact production failures have on software systems and to develop stronger plans to mitigate failures in the future.

* SRE also focuses on <mark>capacity planning</mark>, a process that determines the resources that are needed to run essential business functions, scale those business functions and develop new applications and features. In addition, SRE teams establish metrics that are used to evaluate the delivery of updates and the implementation of new features.
